While it is most easily prepared by simply mixing boiled rice and yogurt, more elaborate methods can be used when needed. One of these recipes is given here: Rice is boiled so that it breaks down, becoming almost like a paste. Bring it to room temperature. It is then seasoned with fried finely chopped green chillies, ginger, and curry leaves, and sometimes along with the tadka of urad dal, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida. Finally, milk, yogurt, and salt are added.

Alternatively, it can be prepared by mashing cooked plain rice (mostly leftovers), and then mixing it with some salt, yogurt and (a bit of milk to lessen the sour flavor of yogurt or to stop it from souring too much) garnishing it with fried urad dal, mustard seeds, green chilli and chopped cilantro
